The main idea is to create an App where users can watch ads that are relevant to their interests & job and earn some fee for that. This way Business companies get the hottest target audience for their adverting and other marketing goals.

The quickest way to test it would be to proceed first to the User Mode, have a quick view of defaults settings. At Profile folder one can personalize the App. Once you choose the field you work at (Occupation folder), the ads below will be changed. Every time you provide more info at Hobbies, Food, Pets etc. folders, the ads at the scroll view below will get more and more relevant to your personal interests and needs. Account form has some basic info such as email&password to test Sign-In menu. The last folder named Balance calculates the number of ads watched and the total amount earned. 
If you proceed to Business Mode you can imagine that you need to place an ad for your target audience. Very quick and short forms - Profile & Create your ad - will help you to set personalized advertising (Remember the industry you have chosen for your company). Check the preview of your ad at "Watch your ad" and then go back to Private User Mode. If you indicate the same industry at Occupation folder that you have chosen at Business mode before, and run the ad below after that, the user will get the Company's personalized ad & info.
